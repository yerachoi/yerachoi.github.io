I read Thomas Gilovich's **"How We Know What Isn't So: The Fallibility of Human Reason in Everyday Life"** years ago when I was taking a course designed to develop critical thinking skills for understanding scientific studies. Now I feel a need to revisit the lessons from the course and plan to review the book chapter by chapter.
